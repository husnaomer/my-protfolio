            Weather App is a web application that I created using HTML, CSS,
            APi, and JavaScript. It allows users to check the current weather
            for any city in the world, as well as the forecast for the next five
            days. It provides information such as temperature, humidity, wind
            speed, and the feel-like temperature. It also shows the weather
            condition using icons and colors.

            Benefits of Sketching to your Mental Health is a project that I
            created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is an informational
            website that aims to raise awareness and educate people about the
            mental wellness associated with sketching. It provides information
            on how sketching can boost creativity, enhance motor skills, and
            promote mindfulness.
